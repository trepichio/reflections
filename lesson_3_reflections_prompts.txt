Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: when I want to share my repo with other people and work together with them, 
and also when I want to have a kind of backup so I can pull the repo anywhere I need.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: I'm not sure but I think it's because you probably don't want someone else's work on the remote accidentially messes yours.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Clones = when you want to copy a remote (or local) repository to your local PC you just use git clone command.
Branches = It's like different paths for your commits apart from the master branch on your own repository. It's very useful when you want to experiment something or add a new feature on your code whitout breaking your production environment, then you can join their changes into the master branch later if you want to.
Forks = It's very similiar to clone, but in the GitHub context. This means that using Fork you can clone someone's repository to your GitHub account. This is very useful when you don't have permission to change someone's repo but you still want to try to contribute to the project with your changes. Forking also links the original repo to yours as a reference so anyone can check the differences you made from the original.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: You can know before pushing commits to a remote if your commit states are ahead or diverged from it.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: I'd be sharing my files on clouds system like dropbox, downloading them, renaming them each time I've changed and so my collaborators. We'd keep commenting about code with each other by chat or writting down comments on files.
It would be very hard and a consuming task to track the differences between old files and new one.
Certainly, it's much easier to track the changes made in multiple files by several people and point at mistakes and give suggestions using the powerful tools Git/GitHub provide such as history log, branches, merges, pull request, comments and so on.
